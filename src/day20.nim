  Egads, another maze map thingy. :(

  This is a shortest path puzzle with the twist that you can warp between labeled points. Points have an inner and an outer label. Only . is traversable, and labeled . warps you, except for AA (start) and ZZ (end).

  Read vertically stacked labels with the upper letter first.
